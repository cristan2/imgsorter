[ ] 1 - CLI / config file args
    [ ] CLI or config file?
    [ ] a - arg for paths
    [ ] b - arg for min count for move
    [ ] c - arg flag for logfile
    [ ] d - arg flag for target dir
    [x] e - defaults for options
    [ ] f - print options before confirmation
    [ ] g - skip files without EXIF (videos, images from other programs, etc.)?

[x] 2 - File handling
    [x] a - subdirs by device name
    [x] b - filter supported files
    [x] c - handle video - mp4, etc.
    [x] d - handle unknown files
    [x] e - copy/move file only if it's supported file
    [x] f - handle dir creation fail / dir already exists
    [ ] source recursive
    [ ] prefer date taken over date modified
    [ ] EXIF for video data

[ ] 3 - Stats
    [ ] a - show in progress statistics
    [x] b - show final statistics - x files found, x dirs created, x files moved, x files left untouched...
    [ ] c - img count in dir name

[ ] 4 - Config
    [ ] a - config file - rename device with custom name (i.e. personal name instead of camera name)

[ ] 5 - Optimize code
    [x] a - struct to model "supported file" with required metadata (file name, device info, date, etc)
    [ ] b - separate module for "file utils"
    [ ] c - logging (replace debug printouts plus check every match/Err and ?)
    [ ] d - better error handling
    [ ] e - better name for SupportedFile (or maybe don't accept Unknown file types)
    [ ] f - universal line terminators

[ ] 6 - Misc / bugs
    [x] a - change copy to rename
    [ ] b - cleanup
    [x] c - fix warnings
    [x] d - fix eroare "Access is denied." daca rulezi a doua oara si target files exista 
          - eroare cand target dir exista si se incearca citire metadate
    [x] e - run with debug - optional debug printouts
    [ ] create_subdir_if_required shouldn't rely on CWD to strip prefix
    [ ] only create device name subdirs if there's more than one
    [ ] string padding for dry run

[ ] 7 - Nice to have
    [ ] a - undo ?
    [ ] b - maybe don't read file list into memory
    [ ] c - search recursively into existing subdirs (but skip "imgsorted" target subdir)
    [ ] better confirmation
    [ ] how to treat existing files - skip, overwrite, rename
    [ ] after move, leave a txt file in place named "where are my photos" which explains where they were moved (process summary); have option to disable this
