[-] 'dirs created' stat - differentiate between "date dirs" and "device dirs"

- implement Display for Args and print before confirmation
- clippy
- documentation - readme

[ ] 1 - CLI / config file args
    [x] CLI or config file?
    [x] a - arg for paths
    [x] b - arg for min file count required to create date dir (i.e. avoid 1-image dirs)
    [x] d - arg flag for target dir
    [x] e - defaults for options
    [x] f - print options before confirmation
    [x] use args.debug instead of DBG_ON
    [x] use custom extensions
    [ ] arg flag for logfile
    [ ] skip files without EXIF (videos, images from other programs, etc.)?
    [ ] allow configurable target_sorted_subdir_name = 'imgsorted'
    [x] verbose option - output more info (less than debug)

[x] 2 - File handling
    [x] a - subdirs by device name
    [x] b - filter supported files
    [x] c - handle video - mp4, etc.
    [x] d - handle unknown files
    [x] e - copy/move file only if it's supported file
    [x] f - handle dir creation fail / dir already exists
    [ ] g - if there are only two files for two devices, ignore the file without EXIF info ?
    [x] prefer date taken over date modified
    [x] dry run/copy output - sort dirs by name (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59799388/sort-hashmap-data-by-keys)
    [ ] EXIF for video data?
    [x] replace rexif crate with kamadak-exif (support for HEIF)
    [ ] depth limit for source recursive subdirs
    [x] additional file formats - amr, etc
    [x] calculate total file size
    [x] don't create device subdirs if only one file per device (even if device count > 1)

[ ] 3 - Stats
    [x] a - show in progress statistics
    [x] b - show final statistics - x files found, x dirs created, x files moved, x files left untouched...
    [!] c - img count in dir name - not feasible, prone to errors; is included in dry run output only
    [ ] d - reenable Stats.time_fetching_dirs
    [x] dry run specific statistics
    [-] 'dirs created' stat - differentiate between "date dirs" and "device dirs"
    [ ] stats for "could not read EXIF"
    [x] table-like stats instead of simple list (e.g. "Images moved/copied/skipped    0 | 10 | 2" )
    [!] don't include move/copy stats for copy/move operations - not doing, it's relevant in case of delete errors
    [x] stats for file size
    [x] stats for time taken - prefetching dirs, parsing files, copying files

[ ] 4 - Config
    [x] a - config file - rename device with custom name (i.e. personal name instead of camera name) - see 8d
    [x] config file - instead of CLI?

[ ] 5 - Optimize code
    [x] a - struct to model "supported file" with required metadata (file name, device info, date, etc)
    [ ] b - separate module for "file utils"
    [ ] c - logging (replace debug printouts plus check every match/Err and ? plus add files omitted by compact mode)
    [ ] d - better error handling (e.g. check all `.unwrap()`s)
    [ ] e - better name for SupportedFile (or maybe don't accept Unknown file types)
    [ ] f - universal line terminators
    [ ] g - macro for padding formats which take a variable for fill char - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69173413/does-the-rust-format-macro-provide-for-user-specified-fill-characters
    [ ] h - improve maps duplication - use drain_filter or partition or retain or something else
    [ ] i - move map methods to *DeviceTree
    [ ] k - Reimplement is_source_unique
    [x] g - Store total count of files and maybe file size when reading source files
    [x] h - Fix/refactor/improve padding calculation
    [x] m - move `if args.source_recursive` to Args constructor
    [ ] n - don't make isolate_single_images consuming
    [ ] RightPadding & ColoredString should take both &str and String
    [ ] cache result of padding length calculations and other improvements
    [ ] improve performance of parse_dir_contents (150-218 secs for 6000 files)
    [ ] run clippy
    [ ] single method for printing stats instead of two almost identical?

[ ] 6 - Misc / bugs
    [x] a - change copy to rename
    [x] c - fix warnings
    [x] d - fix eroare "Access is denied." when running the program a second time and target files exist 
          - the error happens when the target dir exists and attempting to read metadate
    [x] e - run with debug - optional debug printouts
    [ ] f - handle source path not exists / guard against setting invalid CliArgs values
    [ ] g - fix edge cases for moving assorted files ()
    [ ] h - filename padding during dry runs is sometimes bigger
          - should be calculated as max (target_path_len + depth_len)
    [ ] i - get_source_unique_files only looks at file names, not date or device 
            - dry runs might report more skipped duplicates than will actually be found when writing 
    [x] create_subdir_if_required shouldn't rely on CWD to strip prefix
    [x] only create device name subdirs if there's more than one
    [x] option to always create device name subdirs even if there's only one
    [x] string padding for dry run
    [x] device_tree.max_dir_path_len ignores the length of oneoffs dir - having a long dir name leads to panic!
    [ ] SupportedFile.extension is never used

[ ] 7 - Output
    [x] print unknown extensions for skipped files
    [ ] implement Display for Args and print before confirmation
    [ ] better confirmation
    [ ] Move operation statuses to map and calculate max header and separator lengths based on them
    [x] colored separator arrows
    [ ] separator arrow color should match file copy status (needs rework of how statuses are returned and colored)
    [ ] increase padding spaces from 1 to 2
    [x] dry run - option to not print everything, truncate after e.g. 5 files in same folder with same status (but save everything to log)
    [x] prettier dir trees (show branches ending when reaching last entry)
    [ ] show dir tree when presenting the source paths before confirmation, instead of a simple list of paths
        - show full path only for the sources in config, not for the recursively found subdirs
        - maybe show no of files next to each dir

[ ] 8 - Nice to have
    [ ] a - undo ?
    [ ] b - maybe don't read file list into memory?
    [ ] c - search recursively into existing subdirs (but skip "imgsorted" target subdir)
    [-] d - additional option to read and generate list of devices - this can be filled in and re-read as config - see 4a
    [ ] how to treat existing files - skip, overwrite, rename
    [ ] how to treat files without EXIF (e.g. images received over WhatsApp)
    [ ] after move, leave a txt file in place named "where are my photos" which explains where they were moved (process summary); have option to disable this
    [x] colored text
    [ ] crate for colors and format - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69981449/how-do-i-print-colored-text-to-the-terminal-in-rust
    [ ] more comments and examples for Padder methods + rearrange more logically

[ ] 9 - Docs
    [ ] explain statistics info
    [ ] main flows

[ ] 10 - Cleanup
